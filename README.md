# JSON Path Reference Implementation

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This Reference Implementation follows, and usually lags behind, the [internet draft](https://jsonpath-standard.github.io/internet-draft/).

See [grammar.pest](src/grammar.pest) for the Parsing Expression Grammar of the Reference Implementation.

See the [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPING.md) if you want to run the code against the test suite. See the [Contributor Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to submit changes.

The Compliance Test Suite is in its own [repository](https://github.com/jsonpath-standard/jsonpath-compliance-test-suite).
